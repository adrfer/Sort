//: > **Important:**
//: > This is a preliminary document of sorting algorithms writen in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).
//: > The code was tested on _Xcode 7_ and _Swift 2.1_.
//:
//: Welcome to the Sort Playground!
//:
//: The idea here is to have fun while learning and exploring alternative implementations of different sorting techniques written in Swift, a modern and very exciting programming language. So, to better experience how to move from disarray to order when managing collections of data, some variations of these sorting algorithms are provided, starting with a classic implementation that is iterated over to become more Swift-y.
//:
//: Now, you're about to indulge yourself with the following takes:
//:
//: - The Classic, a die-hard style, rooted in tradition, in all its imperative glory
//: - The Swift-ish, a nifty take on the classic, but strives to use more modern laguage constructs
//: - The Swiftest, a highly creative approach that attempts to tap into the most powerful features yet
//: - The Generic, a play on the swiftest version, but elevated to a type-agnostic nirvana status
//:
//: I know, I know, talk is cheap, show me the code, right?
//:
//: Ok then, ready? Let's dive in!
