//: ----
//:
//: Here are some future ideas yet to be implemented, that's all.
//:
//: ### Current
//: - Review and/or include an implementation that takes a closure (or predicate), similar to `sort` from the [Swift Standard Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios//documentation/Swift/Reference/Swift_MutableCollectionType_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/swift/intfm/MutableCollectionType/s:FeRq_Ss21MutableCollectionTypeqq_Ss16MutableIndexable5IndexSs21RandomAccessIndexType_SsS_9partitionuRq_S_qq_S0_5IndexS1__FRq_FTGVSs5Rangeqq_S0_5Index_15isOrderedBeforeFTqqq_Ss14CollectionType9GeneratorSs13GeneratorType7Elementqqq_S3_9GeneratorS4_7Element_Sb_qq_S0_5Index)
//: - Review and/or include a functional implementation, including aspects as no side-effects, immutability, and reusable/composable functions
//: - Refactor tests into its own playground page, if possible
//:
//: ### Other
//: - Heap Sort
//: - Shell Sort
