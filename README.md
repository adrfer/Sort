# Sort
Alluring experiments with sorting algorithms, sort of.

Tested against `Swift 3` and `Xcode 8`.

### Welcome to the Sort Playground!

This is about exploring alternative implementations of different sorting techniques written in [Swift](http://swift.org).

In order to move from disarray to order when managing collections of data, some variations of these sorting algorithms are provided, starting with a classic implementation that is then forged over and over until it becomes more idiomatic, or simply, more Swift-y.

Indulge yourself with the following takes:

- **The Classic:** a die-hard style, rooted in tradition, in all its imperative glory
- **The Swift-ish:** a sligthly more modern take on the classic, but still not quite quaint enough
- **The Swiftest:** a nifty approach that attempts to tap into the most powerful features of the language yet
- **The Generic:** a play on the swiftest version, but elevated to a type-agnostic nirvana status
- **The Functional:** a quirky take that unleashes some of the neat declarative aspects of the language
- **The Bonus:** a twist on both the swift-ish and generic versions that takes an ordering predicate

Also, a few test cases covering some initial conditions are included:

- Sorted
- Nearly Sorted
- Reversed
- Shuffled

I know, I know... Talk is cheap, show me the code, right?
