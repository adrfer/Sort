# Sort
Careless experiments with sorting algorithms in Swift.

The code was tested on `Xcode 7` and `Swift 2.1`.

**Important:**
This is a preliminary document of sorting algorithms writen in the [Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

Welcome to the Sort Playground!

The idea here is to have fun while learning and exploring alternative implementations of different sorting techniques written in Swift, a modern and very exciting programming language. So, to better experience how to move from disarray to order when managing collections of data, some variations of these sorting algorithms are provided, starting with a classic implementation that is forged over and over until it becomes more Swift-y.

Now, you're about to indulge yourself with the following takes:

- The Classic, a die-hard style, rooted in tradition, in all its imperative glory
- The Swift-ish, a sligthly more modern take on the classic, but still not quite quaint enough
- The Swiftest, a nifty approach that attempts to tap into the most powerful language features yet
- The Generic, a play on the swiftest version, but elevated to a type-agnostic nirvana status

Also, a few test cases covering some initial conditions were added:

- Sorted
- Nearly Sorted
- Reversed
- Shuffled

I know, I know... Talk is cheap, show me the code, right?

Okey-dokey, so let's dive in!
